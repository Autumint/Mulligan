Deck consists of Clubs and Diamonds, Spades and Diamonds cannot spawn  
At the end of each payout shift between two states, **Alive** and **Dead**  
Both states have their own money and jokers and both of them will gain blind reward money and the remaining hand bonus regardless of which one was active

## Benighted Deck
Start run with the **Overstock**, **Planet Tycoon**, **Tarot Tycoon** Vouchers and the Active Item: **Star Shaper**
Naturally obtained jokers will be transformed into 2 random consumables (Spectral, Tarot or Planet)

Use **Star Shaper** to obtain a joker by slotting 3 consumables into it. Better consumables reward you with better jokers.

---

## Dried Deck
Start run with the Active Items: **Chisel** and **Sketch**  
Jokers now suffer from **Erosion**  
-2 Joker Slots  

At the end of each round, if there are no jokers with the **Eroding** sticker, a random joker will start to **Erode**  
**Eroding** jokers can't be sold and become the **Dried Joker** after 2 rounds.  
When a joker turns into the **Dried Joker**, they will lose their effect but also permamently increase the joker slots by 1  

Use **Chisel** to recover a **Dried Joker** by turning it into a random joker  
Use **Sketch** to "write down" any joker, whether it is from the shop, a booster pack, or the joker card area. Using the **Chisel** while a joker is written will always turn the **Dried Joker** into the written joker. Only one joker can be written down at once and will be lost when **Chisel** has been used.  

---

## Dauntless Deck
Skipping blinds now challenges them instead, granting a skip tag but having to fight a blind with 1.5x scaling  
Start run with the **Fervency** counter at **50**  

Rerolls, purchases, played hands and discards all deplete or increase **Fervency** depending on its current state  
**Fervency** has two states, **Cooling** and **Heating**  
In **Cooling**, which is the starting state, actions decrease Fervency  
In **Heating**, actions increase Fervency  
To swap **Fervency**'s state, a blind must be challenged  
Going below **40** or above **60** **Fervency** will slowly reduce Xmult  
Reaching 0 or 100 **Fervency** ends the run  

---

## Capricious Deck 
Start run with the Active Item: **Debug Card**  
+1 Joker Slot  
All jokers now suffer from **ERR_EVERCHANGING**  

When a Joker with **ERR_EVERCHANGING** is taken into a blind, it will immediately be rerolled into another joker.  
Use **Debug Card** to remove **ERR_EVERCHANGING** from a specific joker
